**💚 Wesley Hack Club**
**Wesley Hack Club is a student-led coding and technology community at Wesley College**, built for students who love creating, hacking, and learning by doing.
We meet every Tuesday during lunchtime in the Hamer Building, where members collaborate on real projects, prepare for hackathons, compete in Capture-the-Flag challenges, and explore topics ranging from web development and game design to cybersecurity and AI.
The club is connected to the global Hack Club organization, a worldwide network of student-run programming clubs that empowers students to build projects, ship code, and grow as engineers.
